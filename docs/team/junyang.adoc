== Project: BoNUS
BoNUS is a desktop personal organizer application created for National University of Singapore (NUS) students, by NUS students.
The application aims to better organize the lives of NUS students. This is accomplished through having a contacts list
for students to keep up with their social lives and a planner for students to keep abreast of their upcoming events in school.
BoNUS uses a Command Line Interface (CLI) where users input their commands to a console.

This project is the result of a semester-long Software Engineering module, https://nus-cs2103.github.io/website/[CS2103T],
in NUS. BoNUS is developed alongside my teammates  based on https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4[Address Book (Level 4)], an initiative from the
https://se-edu.github.io/[SE-EDU team], the current codebase has expanded to around 10 kLoC. The backend of the application
is done in Java. The frontend of the application is mostly done up with JavaFX.

=== Enhancement Added: Auto Reminders

==== External behavior

---

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=autoReminders]


---

==== Justification

The support for auto reminders in BoNUS is pivotal. Taking into consideration the busy schedules of students, having an auto reminder
function allows students to be more in line with their upcoming events.

As for the latest BoNUS v1.5 official release, reminders only come in the form of additional icons at the side of their events.
We seek to further improve the auto reminders function to allow students to be notified of upcoming events in a better manner.

==== Realization

=== Enhancement proposed: Booking of facilities from NUS

==== External behavior

---

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=bookingNUS]

---

==== Justification

Since NUSMods is already being integrated with **BoNUS**, what is another factor that NUS students are largely concerned with in terms of school resources?
The idea of integrating the booking of facilities in NUS with **BoNUS** then came about.

BoNUS is an organizer for NUS students. In view of the busy schedules of students in school, **BoNUS** not only aims to make lives for students more
convenient, but also allow students to be updated of their personal upcoming events. As such, we took into consideration the booking of facilities for consultation, group meetings or even study groups. To facilitate this
, we decided to integrate the booking of facilities with the `Event` component from **BoNUS** such that upon successful booking of facilities,
the `Event` list in **BoNUS** would automatically be updated with your latest booking.

=== Enhancement proposed: Importing of contacts / events from Google

==== External behavior

---

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=importGoogle]

---

==== Justification

Since majority of students often use Google for multiple purposes, GMail, Google Docs or even Google slides. It is no wonder that
most students have Google Accounts and have important information stored within. +

Therefore, to facilitate your transition to **BoNUS**, we have decided to include the import of contacts / events from Google itself,
making the transition to **BoNUS** a comfortable one. Furthermore, as Google acts as a back up for Contact Storage, with **BoNUS**,
it can act as a secondary storage/backup for each of your contacts and events stored in calendar.

With facilitated transition towards **BoNUS**, your life can now be better organized with **BoNUS**.
