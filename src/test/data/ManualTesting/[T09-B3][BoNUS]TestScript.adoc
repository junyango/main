_Figure 1 : User Interface Demo_

=== Prerequisites

. Have Java (JRE) version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
. Download the latest release `[T09-B3][BoNUS].jar`, the sample data `[T09-B3][BoNUS]SampleData.xml` and test instructions
`[T09-B3][BoNUS]TestScript.pdf` (this document itself).
. A folder you want to use as home folder for testing **BoNUS** and copy the `.jar` you have downloaded there.

=== Importing the Sample Data

. Rename the downloaded `[T09-B3][BoNUS]SampleData.xml` to `addressbook.xml`.
. Create a folder called `data` under the home folder used for testing **BoNUS**.
. Move `addressbook.xml` into the `data` folder created just now.

=== Troubleshooting

If you have any doubt or need further clarification, you may want to visit our https://cs2103aug2017-t09-b3.github.io/main/[project website]
for more information.

== Testing

=== Add/view/edit/delete contacts

To add avatar to a contact, we need to use the `avatar` command.

. First, let's list all the contacts in *BoNUS* +
_Command:_ +
`list` +
_Result:_ +
`Listed all persons`

. Add avatar to the third person in the listing (assume there are at least three contacts) +
_Command:_ +
`avatar 3 http://profileengine.com/large/420503790/nus.soc`

=== Add/view/edit/delete events

==== Listing of events
*Positive test case* +
_Command:_ +
`listE`  +
_Result:_ +
`Listed all events`

You should see that the application automatically switches from contact list to event list after
the command listE.


*Negative test case* +
_Command:_ +
`ListE` +
_Result:_ +
`Unknown command` +
_Command:_ +
`lIsTE` +

`Unknown command`

Commands are case sensitive.
